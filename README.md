# Small Python Projects

Welcome to my repository of small Python projects! This collection showcases my work on practical, self-contained programs that solve specific problems or provide useful tools. These projects helped me explore various Python libraries and concepts, including GUI development, command-line tools, and real-world problem-solving.

## Repository Contents

### 1. **GUI Calculator App**
   - **Description**: A simple calculator application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using `customtkinter`.
   - **Features**:
     - Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
     - User-friendly interface with responsive design.
   - **Purpose**: To learn GUI development and build an interactive application.

### 2. **Random Password Generator**
   - **Description**: A command-line tool that generates random passwords based on user-defined requirements.
   - **Features**:
     - Customizable password length and the abiltiy to choose how many special characters in the password.
     - Ensures a completely random password is generated. 
   - **Purpose**: To practice command-line programming and explore randomization techniques in Python.

### 3. **CS111 Grade Calculator**
   - **Description**: A grade calculator specifically designed for tracking progress in my CS111 class.
   - **Features**:
     - Calculates the current grade based on user-provided scores.
     - Allows updates as new scores are added.
   - **Purpose**: To simplify grade tracking and reinforce Python programming concepts learned in class Note: This was part of a python project assignment which I coded based off parameters provided by the assignment docs.

## Notes

- These projects are designed to be small and self-contained, making them easy to explore and adapt.
- As I work on more projects, I will update this repository to reflect my progress in Python programming.
